# Mini-Map Generator
This is a mini-map generator:
1. You can modify the map by changing multiple lines of string in Scene.js, where `o` represents a wall, `number` represents different rooms, and `-` represents empty.
2. The map walls will be generated automatically, similar to the principle of a Pokemon map.
3. You can move the Pokemon ⬅️⬆️⬇️➡️ with the keyboard. The Pokemon will be blocked by the wall.
4. Open the **web developer tools**, check the `console`, you can detect in real time which room the Pokemon is in on the map.
